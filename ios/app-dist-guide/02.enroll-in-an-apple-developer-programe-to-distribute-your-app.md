> During enrollment, you’ll be asked for basic personal information, including your legal name and address. If you’re enrolling as a company or organization, you'll need to provide a few more things, like your legal entity name and D-U-N-S Number, as part of the verification process. Once your information is verified, you’ll review license agreements, purchase your program on the Apple Online Store, and receive details on how to activate your membership.

You can always add more Apple Developer Program memberships to your account. For example, you can first join the iOS Developer Program and later add the Mac Developer Program and the Safari Developer Program.
