关于App的分发
=============

> This guide explains how to develop, test, submit, and release your iOS and Mac apps. By understanding your tools and the distribution process, you’ll be able to get your new app and updates to your customers faster.

> To submit your app to the store, you use Xcode features and several web tools available only to members of an Apple Developer Program. Even before you can develop with technologies, such as iCloud and Game Center, you must join an Apple Developer Program. You should join a program even if you distribute your application outside of the Mac App Store so that customers know your application comes from a known source.

> Once you join a program, you can start using store services from your app, testing your app on devices, providing marketing, sales, and contact information, and submitting versions of your app for approval. You iterate the steps of this distribution process, as necessary, until your app is approved and released. Then you repeat some of these steps again for each subsequent update.
